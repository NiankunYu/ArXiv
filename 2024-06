we find that present-day superthin galaxies had similar morphologies as the control sample counterparts at higher redshifts, but have developed extended flat `superthin' morphologies since z∼1. During this latter evolution stage, superthin galaxies undergo overwhelmingly higher frequency of prograde mergers (with orbit-spin angle θorb⩽40∘).
